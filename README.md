# Movies_ETL

## Summary

The purpose of this assignment is to go through the ETL process on movie data.  My ETL process is defined in a function so that the code can be re run as data is changed/added to the files.  I first extract data from a raw json file and two csv files.  I then clean the data to drop unncessary columns or row or merge redundant data.  I will then merge the json file and one csv file into a single data frame.  I will then go through the Load process by uploading the data into a database from pgAdmin.  Here, we can use the database to find valubale insights on the clean data in an efficient way.
